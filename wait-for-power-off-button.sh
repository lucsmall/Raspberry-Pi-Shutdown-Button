# Waits for a button press and then shuts down Raspberry Pi
#
# Momentary switch is connected between physical pins 25 and 26 on
# the GPIO header
#
# Script lives at:
#
# /home/pi/off-button/
#
# This script is added to crontab (with crontab -e) as follows:
#
# @reboot /home/pi/off-button/wait-for-power-off-button.sh
#
# All output goes to stdout and log file

# From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3173131
# Redirect stdout to a named pipe running tee with append
exec > >(tee -a /home/pi/off-button/log.txt)
# Redirect stderr to stdout
exec 2>&1
