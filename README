Waits for a button press and then shuts down Raspberry Pi

Momentary switch is connected between physical pins 25 and 26 on
the GPIO header

Script lives at:

/home/pi/off-button/

This script is added to crontab (with crontab -e) as follows:

@reboot /home/pi/off-button/wait-for-power-off-button.sh

All output goes to stdout and log file
